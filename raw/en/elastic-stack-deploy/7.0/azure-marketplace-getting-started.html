<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-au/marketplace/apps/elastic.elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">Azure Marketplace</a> offering, and click the "Get it Now"
button:</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace.png" alt="marketplace"></span></p>
<p>This will take you straight to the solution from the Marketplace, within the
<a href="https://portal.azure.com" class="ulink" target="_top">Azure portal</a>. If you&#8217;re not already logged into the portal, you&#8217;ll be
prompted to do so first.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re ready to proceed, click the Create button to walk through the steps.</p>

<p>Each step of the process is presented in its own blade within the portal, which
we&#8217;ll walk through.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>The first step involves setting up the details for the username and authentication
mechanism you&#8217;ll use to access the virtual machines deployed by the solution:</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace_step1.png" alt="marketplace step1"></span></p>
<p>The username must be a valid Ubuntu username and for authentication mechanism,
choose between password or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows" class="ulink" target="_top">SSH key</a>. When choosing SSH key, password
authentication will be disabled on the virtual machines.</p>
<p>Next, choose the subscription, resource group and location into which to deploy
the solution. When choosing an existing resource group, there a couple of points
to bear in mind</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A resource group is a container that holds related resources. As such,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal" class="ulink" target="_top">those resources share the same lifecycle, permissions and policies</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The solution template deploys in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy#incremental-and-complete-deployments" class="ulink" target="_top">incremental mode</a>; If a previous solution
deployment has been performed into the target resource group, the resources that
exist in the resource group but are not in the template are left unchanged. All resources
that are specified by the solution will be deployed, and for those resources that
already exist and whose settings are unchanged, no change will be made. For those
resources whose settings are changed however, the resource is provisioned with those
new settings. What this means in practice is that you should carefully consider
how the settings specified within the template being deployed may affect the resources
that could be currently running Elasticsearch.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>More often than not, you&#8217;ll want to deploy the solution into a new resource
group. Providing access to Elasticsearch to existing Azure resources such as
Azure App Services can be achieved by connecting the deployed virtual machines
to an existing virtual network, which can be specified in the next step.</p>
</div>

</div></div></div>
<p>the Cluster settings blade provides the option to pick the version of Elasticsearch
to deploy, and give the cluster a name:</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace_step2.png" alt="marketplace step2"></span></p>
<p>Additionally, the solution can deploy a new virtual network or use an existing
virtual network within the same subscription and location as the target resource
group. This is particularly useful in situations where resources may already be
deployed in another resource group, and the cluster should be accessible to those
resources on the same network, and possibly same subnet.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>The Nodes configuration blade controls the number of each
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html" class="ulink" target="_top">type of node</a> to deploy for the cluster:</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace_step3.png" alt="marketplace step3"></span></p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Elasticsearch nodes resolve other nodes on the network by their hostname,
which Azure DNS supports. It is therefore critical that when deploying a cluster to
an existing virtual network, the hostnames for Elasticsearch nodes are unique. The
<code class="literal">Hostname prefix</code> input will be applied to the naming convention for master, data and client
nodes, allowing for unique hostnames when deploying multiple clusters to the same
virtual network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For data nodes, the number of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview" class="ulink" target="_top">managed disks</a>,
in addition to size and type of disks,
can be specified. When the number of managed disks is two or more, a RAID 0
array is created across the disks to improve overall operations. When no disks are
specified, the node will use the temp storage of the VM for the data directory.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2013/12/06/understanding-the-temporary-drive-on-windows-azure-virtual-machines/" class="ulink" target="_top">Temp storage</a>, with filesystem <code class="literal">/dev/sdb1</code> mounted on <code class="literal">/mnt</code> in Ubuntu,
is present on the physical machine hosting the VM. It is ephemeral in nature and
not persistent; A VM can move to a different host at <em>any</em> point in time for various
reasons, including hardware failures. When this happens, the VM will be created on
the new host using the OS disk from the storage account, and <em>new temp storage
will be created on the new host</em>.</p>
<p>Using temp storage <em>can</em> be a cost effective way of running an
Elasticsearch cluster on Azure with decent performance, <em>so long</em> as you understand
the tradeoffs in doing so, by snapshotting frequently and ensuring adequate data
redundancy through sufficient replica shards.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>The Kibana &amp; Logstash blade determines whether to deploy Kibana and/or Logstash
in addition to Elasticsearch, as well as how the cluster can be accessed from outside
of the virtual network:</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace_step4.png" alt="marketplace step4"></span></p>
<p>When installing Kibana, a separate VM will be provisioned onto which Kibana will
be deployed and a public IP address will be attached
to the Kibana VM along with a Network Security group, allowing TCP access over ports
5601 and 22. The former is used to connect to Kibana through the browser, whilst
the latter is used to connect to the Kibana VM via SSH.</p>
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/marketplace_step4_2.png" alt="marketplace step4 2"></span></p>
<p>When installing Logstash, a separate VM will be provisioned onto which Logstash
will be deployed. A Logstash configuration file can be specified, as well as additional
Logstash plugins to install.</p>
<p>A jumpbox VM can optionally be deployed, which can be connected to via SSH in order
to gain access to the Elasticsearch VMs.</p>
<p>Either an internal or external load balancer can be deployed from the Marketplace;
When choosing external load balancer, both an internal and external load balancer will
be deployed. Kibana will use the internal load balancer to communicate with Elasticsearch,
and the external load balancer is configured with a public IP address , allowing access
to Elasticsearch from outside of Azure over port 9200.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The Marketplace solution does not configure SSL/TLS for communication for any of</p>

for all inputs in the previous steps, and to read the terms and conditions before
deployment:</p>

<p>The Azure infrastructure also performs some final validation steps. Once you&#8217;re
happy to proceed and the OK button is clicked, a new deployment will be started
and within minutes, you&#8217;ll have Elasticsearch running on Azure!</p>
