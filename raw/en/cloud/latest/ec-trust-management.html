<p>In order to establish a remote connection between two remote clusters, they must both trust each other. Trust is bi-directional: If one of the clusters doesn&#8217;t trust the other, the remote connection won&#8217;t be established.</p>
<p>Mutual trust between two clusters is required to <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-ccs.html" title="Enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication">enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication</a>.</p>
<p>Trust can be configured individually for each deployment.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-trust-account"></a>Default trust behavior in your account<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/shared/ec-ce-trust-management.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, any deployment that you create trusts all other deployments in the same account. You can change this behavior in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Features</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Trust</strong></span>, so that when a new deployment is created it does not trust any other deployment.
You can choose one of the following options:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Trust all my deployments - New deployments will by default trust any other deployment from your account (even deployments that don&#8217;t exist when the deployment is created).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Trust no deployment - New deployments won&#8217;t trust any other deployment when they are created. (This can be changed later in the <a class="xref" href="ec-trust-management.html#ec-trust-deployment" title="Update the trust settings of a deployment">deployment trust settings</a>)

</ul>

<p>Note the following behaviours with this trust setting:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Changing the trust settings affects only deployments that you create in the future. The level of trust of existing deployments is not modified by this setting.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Deployments created before the Elasticsearch Service February 2021 release trust only themselves.
You need to update the trust setting for each deployment that you want to either use as a remote cluster or configure to work with a remote cluster.

Specific deployments - Specify which of the existing deployments you want to trust in the other organization. The full deployment ID must be entered for each deployment.

<p>Note that the organization ID and deployment IDs must be entered fully and correctly. For security reasons, no verification of the IDs is possible. If cross-organization trust does not appear to be working, double-checking the IDs is a good place to start.</p>
