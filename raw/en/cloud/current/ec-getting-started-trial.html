<h3><a id="ec_what_is_included_in_my_trial"></a>What is included in my trial?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-getting-started-trial.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Your 14-day free trial includes a deployment to explore Elastic solutions for Enterprise Search, Observability, Security, or the latest version of the Elastic Stack. Each deployment includes 8 GB of RAM spread out over two availability zones with enough storage space to get you started. If you’re looking to evaluate a smaller workload, you can simply scale down your trial deployment.</p>
<p>Each deployment is packed with powerful Elastic features such Maps, SIEM, machine learning, advanced security, and much more. You have some sample data sets to play with and tutorials that describe how to add your own data.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_what_requires_a_credit_card"></a>What requires a credit card?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-getting-started-trial.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>A credit card is optional for the trial and <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-details.html" title="Add your billing details">can be added later</a>. If all you want to do is try out Elasticsearch and Kibana, the trial includes more than enough to get you started.</p>
<p>Some of the more powerful features can be used effectively only when you add a credit card. For example: If you want to change the deployment size that is greyed out in the UI or if you want to upload a custom plugin, you need to <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-details.html" title="Add your billing details">add a credit card</a> and start paying for Elasticsearch Service.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Trials get converted to paid subscriptions and billing starts when you add a credit card. If you want to maximize your trial, make sure to add your credit card near the end of the trial period. You can check your <a class="xref" href="ec-account-usage.html" title="Monitor and analyze your account usage">account usage</a> and <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-history.html" title="Check your billing history">billing history</a> to monitor your charges, and you can delete a deployment to stop any further charges for it.</p>

<p>A credit card is not required as part of your free trial. However, some of the more powerful features can be used effectively only when you add a credit card. This includes increasing the memory or storage of any of the components of your deployment, such as the Elasticsearch cluster, machine learning nodes, or the APM server. The ability to create multiple deployments, adding a third availability zone, and use cross-cluster search or cross-cluster replication also require a credit card.</p>
<p>Trials get upgraded to a pay-as-you-go subscription when you add a credit card. If you want to maximize your trial, make sure to add your credit card near the end of the trial period. You can check your account activity and billing history to monitor your charges, and you can delete a deployment to stop any further charges for it.</p>
