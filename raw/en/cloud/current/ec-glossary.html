</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Contains resources available to an Elasticsearch Service installation that are isolated from other availability zones to safeguard against failure. Could be a rack, a server zone, or some other logical constraint that creates a failure boundary. In a highly available cluster, the nodes of a cluster are spread across two or three availability zones to ensure that the cluster can survive the failure of an entire availability zone.

<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="instance"></a>instance
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A product from the Elastic Stack that is running in a deployment, such as an Elasticsearch node or a Kibana instance. When you choose more <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#zone">availability zones</a>, the system automatically creates more instances for you.

<a id="master-node"></a>master node
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Responsible for cluster-wide actions, such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. Improves the resilience of Elasticsearch, but does not handle requests and does not hold any data. Master nodes need fewer CPU and memory resources and less storage than other nodes. Also check <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#node">node</a> in this glossary and <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/modules-node.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Node</a> in the Elasticsearch documentation.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="node"></a>node
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A running instance of Elasticsearch which belongs to a cluster, typically one per host. Nodes will look to discover an existing cluster by the same name when they start up and try to join that cluster.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="no-op"></a>no-op (no operation) plan
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The application of a rolling update on your deployment without actually applying any configuration changes. This type of update can be useful to resolve certain health warnings. Check <a class="xref" href="ec-deployment-no-op.html" title="Scenario: How do I resolve deployment health warnings?">Scenario: How do I resolve deployment health warnings?</a>.

<a id="tiebreaker"></a>tiebreaker
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Prevents cases of <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production#split-brains" class="ulink" target="_top">split brain</a> in distributed clusters, where a cluster splits into multiple, autonomous parts that continue to handle requests independently of each other, at the risk of affecting cluster consistency and data loss. Ensures a quorum-based majority of (<em>n</em>/2)+1 nodes, where <em>n</em> is the number of nodes in the cluster. The minimum number of master nodes to reach quorum in a two-node cluster is the same as for a three-node cluster: two nodes must be available.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="vcpu"></a>vCPU
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
vCPU stands for virtual central processing unit. vCPUs are virtual compute units assigned to your nodes. The value is dependent on the size and hardware profile of the instance. The instance may be eligible for vCPU boosting depending on the size.

<a id="zookeeper"></a>ZooKeeper
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
