<h3><a id="ec-version-policy-available"></a>Available Elastic Stack versions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-version-policy.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Stack versions are denoted as <code class="literal">X.Y.Z</code>, where <code class="literal">X</code> is the major version, <code class="literal">Y</code> is the minor version, and <code class="literal">Z</code> is the patch level or maintenance release (version 7.17.0, for example).</p>
<p>We make the two latest minor versions of the latest major version available for provisioning. In addition, the latest minor version of the previous major version is also available.</p>
<p>Previous maintenance releases are removed as new ones becomes available. Only the latest maintenance release within an available minor version is available.</p>
<p>You might sometimes notice additional versions listed in the user interface beyond what we guarantee to be available, such as <a class="xref" href="ec-version-policy.html#ec-release-builds" title="Release candidates and cutting-edge releases">release candidate builds</a>. If a version is listed in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>, it can be deployed.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-version-policy-new"></a>New Elastic Stack versions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-version-policy.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Whenever a new Elastic Stack version is released, we do our best to provide the new version on our hosted service at the same time. We send you an email and add a notice to the console, recommending an upgrade. You&#8217;ll need to decide whether to upgrade to the new version with new features and bug fixes or to stay with a version you know works for you a while longer.</p>
<p>There can be <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/breaking-changes.html" class="ulink" target="_top">breaking changes</a> in some new versions of Elasticsearch that break what used to work in older versions. Before upgrading, you&#8217;ll want to check if the new version introduces any changes that might affect your applications. A breaking change might be a function that was previously deprecated and that has been removed in the latest version, for example. If you have an application that depends on the removed function, the application will need to be updated to continue working with the new version of Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>To learn more about upgrading to newer versions of the Elastic Stack on our hosted service, check <a class="xref" href="ec-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">Upgrade Versions</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-version-policy-critical"></a>Upgrades or restart for critical issues<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-version-policy.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>We reserve the right to force upgrade or restart a cluster immediately and without notice in advance if there is a critical security or stability issue. Such upgrades happen only within minor versions.</p>
<p>A forced upgrade or restart might become necessary in a situation that:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Bypasses Shield, where knowing only the cluster endpoint is sufficient to gain access to data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Disrupts our ability to effectively manage a cluster in disaster scenarios
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Impairs stability to the point where we cannot guarantee cluster node or data integrity
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Impairs or risks impairing our infrastructure
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ec-release-builds"></a>Release candidates and cutting-edge releases<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-version-policy.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Interested in kicking the tires of Elasticsearch releases at the cutting edge? We sometimes make release candidate builds and other cutting-edge releases available in Elasticsearch Service for you to try out.</p>
<div class="caution admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Remember that cutting-edge releases are used to test new function fully. These releases might still have issues and might be less stable than the GA version. There&#8217;s also no guaranteed upgrade path to the GA version when it becomes available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying out one of these cutting-edge releases, we don&#8217;t recommended upgrading an existing deployment directly. Instead, use a copy of your existing data with a test deployment, first.</p>
<p>Cutting-edge releases do not remain available forever. Once the GA version of Elasticsearch is released, your deployment needs to be removed after a grace period. We cannot guarantee that you will be able to upgrade to the GA version when it becomes available.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-version-policy-eol"></a>End-of-life versions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-70/docs/saas/ec-version-policy.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>We follow the Elastic official end-of-life (EOL) policy for the Elastic Stack. This means that we support each major release of our products for 18 months from the General Availability date, and we actively maintain the last minor release of the two most recent major branches of the Elastic Stack, in accordance with the <a href="/support/eol" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Product End of Life Dates</a>.</p>
<p>We give you six months advance notice before a minor version nears its end-of-life, effectively providing you with six months time <a class="xref" href="ec-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">to upgrade to a newer version</a> yourself. Advance notice is given by email to the primary contact registered in Elastic Cloud.</p>
<p>If you do not upgrade to an available newer minor version by the end-of-life date, we reserve the right to force upgrade in the event of a major security incident in order to mitigate potential security risks.</p>
<p>For major versions that reach end-of-life:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
We continue to provide support for up to six months after EOL for the last minor version of a major version (sometimes referred to as <em>extended-end-of-life</em> (EEOL) or <em>end-of-extended-support</em>).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After six months have passed, the cluster goes out of support. To continue receiving support, you must first upgrade your cluster to a version that has not yet reached end-of-life.
